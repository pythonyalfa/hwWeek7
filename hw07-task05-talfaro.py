# Task 05
# Write a coin ﬂipping class that inherits from the die class. Bet you never thought of a coin as a
# two sided die. It would contain the following changes:
# - The constructor should not take any arguments as a coin usually only has two sides
# - A ﬂip method that uses the roll method. If the roll is 1, return "HEADS". if it is 2, return "TAILS"

#Class usage Example output of script
#nickle = Coin()
#nickle.roll()                          #1
#nickle.flip()                          #TAILS
#nickle.roll_multiple(4)                #[1, 1, 2, 1]
